My terrible website. Secretly a URL shortener.

R.I.P. Firebase Dynamic Links, you were my only URL shortening savior.
Bit.ly is okay, but I need more control.

https://estyria.page.link/ <- 26 characters (currently using, but will be obsolete)
https://krqt.github.io/ <- 23 characters (you are here)
https://krq.page.link/ <- 22 characters (saved this, but will be obsolete)
